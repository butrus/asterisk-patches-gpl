This is a repository of my Asterisk (www.asterisk.org) patches. The patches are
licenced under the GPLv2 General Public Licence. As I'm not willing to sign
any copyright agreement with Digium it is unlikely that these patches will
go into Asterisk's upstream.

You may however (I do explicitly allow this) study the patches and then
write your own solving the same problem or implementing similar functionality
and then submit those to Digium on your own.


Currently, following patches are available:

1) for asterisk-11.13.1~dfsg (Debian Wheezy Backports as of Nov 9, 2017)

 • asterisk-voicemail-any-variables+bugifxes.patch

This patch allows the Voicemail application to use any variable available
to the appropriate asterisk channel (and not just a couple of predefined
variables like VM_CIDNAME, VM_CIDNUM etc.) to be used for text substitutions
of field defined in voicemail.conf (the is mostly of interrest for the IMAP
backend or for paging). For more about the problem, see:
http://lists.digium.com/pipermail/asterisk-users/2007-August/194717.html

Moreover, now you can even use substitutions to 'serveremail' which is
a field in the voicemail.conf defining the sender email adress. This makes
it possible to let the voicemail email message to look like beeing sent
directly from the caller.

E.g. if you set in your diaplan:

exten => *555,1,Answer()
exten => *555,n,Set(TICKET_NR=1234567)
exten => *555,n,Set(VM_CID_EMAIL=john.doe@example.com)
exten => *555,n,Voicemail(1,s)
exten => *555,n,Hangup()

and in the voicemail.conf:

fromstring=${VM_CIDNAME}
serveremail=${VM_CID_EMAIL}
emailsubject=[Ticket ${TICKET_NR}]: New message from ${VM_CIDNAME} (${VM_CIDNUM})

then the email will look like beeing sent from john.doe@example.com and the appropriate
ticket number will appear in the subject.



 • asterisk-voicemail-any-variables+bugifxes+content-type+reply-to.patch

This is a cumulative patch based on the above one. This patch adds two features:

 1) the possibility to set the content-type of the message (e.g. to text/html)
from the voicemail.conf configuration file (the "emailcontenttype" option).

 2) the possibility to set the reply-to field of the message
(via the "emailreplyto" option in voicemail.conf).

Both options support full substitution, so all of the following are valid options:

emailcontenttype=text/html
emailcontenttype=text/${X_CONTENT}
emailreplyto=${CALLER_NAME} <${CALLER_EMAIL}>
emailreplyto=${CALLER_NAME} <${VM_CIDNUM}@kdakosoft.ua>
